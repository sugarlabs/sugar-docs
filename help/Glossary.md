# Glossary

### Activity
Sugar education software module. In other contexts these might be called programs, but we prefer to emphasize what the students can do with them, not where they came from.

### Definition
An association between a name which may mean nothing by itself and a description intended to convey an important idea. Frequently we need a different kind of association between names and ideas, such as pictures, animations, or actual experience. The most important purpose of definitions is to explain what the thing named does; another is to describe its uses, or as we often say its purposes; a third is to describe the appearance of something, so that we can recognize it when we see it; a fourth is to enable us to talk about the thing conveniently with those who already have some idea of it. Usually the order of importance of these purposes is entirely misunderstood.

### Favorite
Activity that shows in the Home view icon ring. A user can mark an Activity as a Favorite in the List view by clicking the star outline next to the Activity name.

### Frame
Popup rectangular border in Sugar showing View icons and active Activities on the top; friend icons on the right; hardware icons on the bottom; and icons for open documents on the left. The frame is activated by putting the mouse cursor into a corner of the screen, or optionally the side (see My Settings), or by pressing the Frame button on the top right of an XO keyboard. Moving the mouse cursor away from the activation area or pressing the Frame button while the Frame is active dismisses the Frame.

### Group View
