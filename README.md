###How to contribute?

Let's first define some necessary definitions.

#####What is a Pull Request?

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed 
to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you 
can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators
and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into 
the repository.

#####What is a Fork?

A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forks let 
you make changes to a project without affecting the original 
repository. You can fetch updates from or submit changes to the 
original repository with pull requests.

Please refer to the following link for details on how to contribute a 
patch and also about how to open issues. :

Let others review your PR before it gets merged to the master branch.
Only maintainers of repository can merge your pull request. If it 
does not happen, then you can contact to :
systems@lists.sugarlabs.org
