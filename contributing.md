Contributing
------------

We use the pull-request model, see [github's help on
pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

In short, you will:

* do your changes in a new branch
* push your branch and submit a pull-request for it
* go through the review process

### Forking

You should fork the repository first.  This step is needed only once.
See [complete help in
github](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).  Brief
instructions follow using [sugar
component](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar) as example:

* navigate <https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar/> and press **Fork** button
* `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-NAME/sugar.git`
* `cd sugar`
* `git remote add upstream https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar.git`
* `git fetch upstream`

### Sending a pull-request

* Create one branch per topic

    git checkout -b topic1

* Make one or more commits
* Push the branch

    git push origin topic1

* Submit a pull request for the branch.  Navigate to your repository
  page in github, switch to the branch you made, and then press the
  **Pull Request** button.

After that, the review process will happen in the pull-request page on
github.  The process ends with one of this:

1. A reviewer merges your request.
2. A reviewer rejects your request providing reasons  (and closes the request).
3. A reviewer requires changes (and closes the request).

In case they ask you for changes,

* Make changes using interactive rebase
<http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages>

    git rebase -i master

* Push the changes to another remote branch

    git push origin topic1:topic1-try2

* Submit the new pull request through the github site as you did before

To do your next contribution, don't forget to pull in changes
from the master repository.

### Keep your fork up to date

Pull in upstream changes:

* `git fetch upstream`
* `git merge upstream/master`

### Reviewing

We encourage testing before merging a pull-request.  So instead of
merging directly with the "merge" button on github UI, you do a local
merge, then test, then push.  See [github help on merging a
pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request).

The github page for the pull-request will provide you the right
commands to do the local merge.  They will be something like:

* get the changes from that branch to a new local branch:

    git checkout -b SOME-USER-topic1 master

    git pull https://github.com/SOME-USER/sugar.git topic1

* Test!

* If everything is fine, merge:

    git checkout master

    git rebase SOME-USER-topic1

    git push origin master
