Building from sources
=====================

Getting started
---------------

Sugar is made of several modules and it often depends on libraries which has not
yet been packaged in linux distributions. To make it easier for developers to
build from sources, we developed a set of scripts that automates builds and
other common development tasks.

Only a few distributions are supported by the scripts, the most popular and
most recent. Unfortunately we can't support everything, especially older
versions, we prefer to focus on making the scripts work really well where
supported. You can choose between the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of

* Fedora 18
* Ubuntu 13.04
* Debian Wheezy

First of all clone the sugar-build git repository

    git clone git://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-build.git

Then enter the main directory and build the source code. It may take some
time, depending on your distribution, computer and network speed

    cd sugar-build
    make build

Finally run it with

    make run

If anything goes wrong, you can check if there are known problems with the
source code, by looking at the
[buildbot status](http://buildbot.sugarlabs.org/waterfall). If it's red
then something is wrong and hopefully developers will fix it soon. If it's
green then the issue is probably not yet known and you should report it.
You can generate useful debug information with

    make bug-report

Developing
----------

All the sources are inside the sugar-build/source directory. You can make
changes using any text editor. If sugar is already running stop it, then
restart it with

    make run

Once in a while you will want to update to the latest sugar sources, issuing
the command

    make pull

It's also a good idea to keep up with the latest sugar-build scripts. You can
do that like for any other git repository

    git pull

Commands reference
------------------

You can run the commands as make arguments

    make build
    make run

Or inside a shell

    make shell

    [sugar-build $] build
    [sugar-build $] run

The following commands are available

* check-system

    Check that all the necessary dependencies are installed in your system.

* pull

    Pull the latest source code. All modules are pulled unless one is
    specified. For example with make::

      make pull-sugar

    And inside the shell::

      pull sugar

* build

    Build the source code. All the modules are built unless one is specified.
    For example with make

      make build-sugar

    And inside the shell

      build sugar

* run

    Run sugar.

* check

    Run tests for sugar-build and all the modules that provides them. It
    should usually be run before submitting patches or pushing changes. It's
    possible to specify a single module using make

      make check-sugar

    And inside the shell

      check sugar

* bug-report

    Generate a bug report.

* clean

    Delete the build artifacts.

* shell

    Open a shell inside the build environment.

* send-patches

    Send the modifications you made as patches, for review and integration
    into the official repository. This command must be run inside the shell
    and from the source directory of the module you modified. Changes must
    have been committed.

Preferences reference
---------------------

You can set a few options by creating a sugar-build/prefs file. For example

    OUTPUT=HDMI1
    RESOLUTION=1024x768

The following preferences are available

* RESOLUTION

    This option is only valid when running from X Window. It specifies the
    resolution of the window containing the sugar desktop in the form
    [width]x[height]. Otherwise the whole screen is used.

* OUTPUT

    This option is only valid when running from a text console. Sugar does
    not work properly on multiple video outputs, so we need to select one
    and turn off the others. By default we select the first output listed
    by RandR. You can set this variable to override that with any other of
    the connected outputs reported by the xrandr command, for example VGA1
    if you have an external monitor.

* PROFILE

    Sugar supports multiple profiles, so that you can run multiple instances
    with the same user. You can specify the name of the profile with this
    option. A random generated one is added to the prefs if you are running
    sugar-build under sugar.

* BUILD_IN_SOURCE

    If this is option is set (to any value) all the modules will be built
    inside the source directory, even if they support out-of-source builds.

Adding a new distribution
-------------------------

To add support for other distributions you first need to add a plugin,
implementing the PackageManager and DistroInfo interfaces. It helps to take
a look at the existing implementations in devbot/plugins.

The next step is to provide distributions specific package names. To do so,
edit the config/packages/deps.json file (or the one with your system version).
The keys of the dictionary are cross distribution dependency names, which are
mapped to a list of dependency specific package names. For example

    "evince typelib": {
        "debian": [
            "gir1.2-evince-3.0"
        ], 
        "fedora": [
            "evince-libs"
        ], 
        "ubuntu": [
            "gir1.2-evince-3.0"
        ]
    } 

Add the correct package name (or names) for your distribution to each
element of the dictionary. If you are not clear on what package you need to
add, you can refer to the config/deps directory, which defines, in several
files, the cross distribution dependencies. For example

    {
        "check": "from gi.repository import EvinceDocument", 
        "checker": "python", 
        "name": "evince typelib"
    } 

You can map it to the package by looking at the check_name field. There are
different kind of checkers, which takes the check field as input.

* python

    This is just a snippet of python code which is evaluated. You should be
    looking either for a classic python library or, when importing from
    "gi.repository", for a typelib file.

* binary

    This checks if an executable file is present on the system. You should
    find the package which contains this file.

* gtkmodule

    These modules are library files which are generally installed in the
    "gtk-[version]/modules", inside the system lib directory.

* include

    It checks for a C header file, inside the system include directory.

* dbus

    Checks for a dbus service. The service file is generally installed in
    share directory, inside dbus-1/services. The extension is "service".

* metacity

    You should look for a package providing a metacity theme. They are
    normally installed under "themes" in the share system directory.

* gstreamer

    This checks for gstreamer plugins. They are library files installed in
    gstreamer-[version], under the system lib directory. 

You should edit buildbot.json in a similar way (there is only one package
there). Finally, you should add to basesystem.json a minimal list of packages
necessary for the system work. If just these are installed it should be able
to boot, function and install new packages.

That's it! If all is configured correctly you should now be able to build
sugar on the new distribution.
