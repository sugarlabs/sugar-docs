Getting Started with Developing
===============================

So you want to contribute to Sugar? You've come to the right place. There is always work to do, and we appreciate any help you can offer.


There are two places you can contribute code to Sugar:

* Sugar Core: the shell, the toolkit, etc.
* Sugar Activities

***Note:*** This page isn't complete. Please add whatever seems important.

Learning the necessary skills
-----------------------------

Here is a list of recommended resources to learn: 

* Python -  [Dive into Python][divepython], [Learn Python the Hard Way][lpthw]
* git - [Pro Git book][progit]
* GTK3 for Python - [Read the Docs GTK+3 book][rtdgtk]
* HTML - [HTML Dog HTML][htmldog html]
* CSS - [HTML Dog CSS][htmldog css]
* Javascript - [CodeAcademy][codeacademy js]

Contributing to Sugar shell and related components
--------------------------------------------------

These are the main skills required for developing Sugar shell and toolkit:

* Python
* C 
* GTK+ 3
* git

### Resources

* The code repository for the Sugar shell is on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/sugarlabs).
>   You will need a GitHub account to contribute and you will need to know git, a version control system.
* See the [Human Interface Guidelines][hig] for background on the Sugar design philosophy.
* Also see the [Development Team][development team] page on the wiki for more information.

Contributing to Activities
--------------------------

These are the main skills required for developing Sugar Activities:

* Python
* GTK+ 3
* git
* HTML, JavaScript, CSS for Web Activities

### Resources

You can get started using this manual - 
[Make your own Sugar Activities][myosa]  

***Note:*** 
This manual is a bit outdated, but most of the information still applies.

You can obtain source code from our [Gitorious instance][gitorious]  
Create an account there, and proceed. It is very much similar to GitHub.

See the [hello-world](https://git.sugarlabs.org/hello-world) activity for basic source code of an activity.  
There are many such hello world activities, 
[search for them on Gitorious](https://git.sugarlabs.org/search?q=hello+world)

See also [Activity Team][activity team] on the Sugar Labs wiki.
