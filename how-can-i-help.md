## <a name="PREPARATIONS"></a> Preparations
Before contributing to Sugar Labs, you should install Sugar-

|Your Equipment |Your Operating System |Recommendations |
|-------------- |--------------------- |--------------- |
|You have only one computer and don't want to erase it |Linux, Windows, macOS, or iOS |Install virtualisation software, make a new virtual machine and install Sugar Live Build, Sugar on a Stick, Ubuntu, Fedora, or Debian. |
|You have only one computer and don't want to erase it  |Linux |Install Sugar packages from your distribution, see Ubuntu, Fedora or Debian. For other distributions, contact your distribution community. |
|You have another computer that can be erased |Doesn't matter |Install Sugar Live Build, Sugar on a Stick, Ubuntu, Fedora, or Debian. |

  * Learn how to use Sugar and activities, see [Help](https://help.sugarlabs.org/),
  * [Setup a development environment](dev-environment.md.html)
  

## <a name="OUTREACHY-GSOC"></a> Coding/Documentation/Quality Assurance
Coding, documentation and quality assurance is important - it is required everywhere from producing new software, rolling out new features, maintaining and upgrading current releases, distributing instructions for others to know how to operating the software, and ensuring that others can use software with any problems.
  * One of the ways you can contribute to Sugar Labs in terms of coding, documentation and quality assurance is to view the [Outreachy and GSoC (Google Summer Of Code) task lists](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Summer_of_Code/2017) in the Sugar Labs wiki. Although the above programs are targeted at youths, however anyone can attempt and complete these tasks. Furthermore, GSoC/Outreachy and Google Code-In (GCI) represent opportunities for mentoring students. (Do note that the list is lightly outdated: some tasks in the task lists have been completed).
  * Another way you can contribute to Sugar Labs is the view the [Release Engineer's Feature Tracking wiki page.](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Features). The wiki page consists of features proposed and implemented by other Sugar Labs community contributors. The progress of the feature is also indicated in the page - please contribute to tasks which are "In Progress".
  * You can test Sugar and Activities and familiarise yourself with Sugar, making a note of where your expectation is betrayed by your observations, then seek feedback from others learn if your expectation was right and post inconsistencies to the coressponding GitHub repository issues page, [Wiki](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org), or mailing list [sugar-devel@lists.laptop.org][2],
  * You can go to a specific GitHub repository and work on the bugs in the source code. Just go to the "Issues" tabs and work through the various issues listed in it. The main Sugar Labs GitHub Repositories are listed in the "Important Sugar Labs Links".
  * You can write documentation, see the [Wiki](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org), the [Help Activity](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Activities/Help/Contribute) which is kept in the [Help](https://github.com/godiard/help-activity) repository, and this [developer documentation](docs.md.html).
  * You can update web sites, see [www.sugarlabs.org](https://www.sugarlabs.org/) which is kept in the [www-sugarlabs](https://github.com/sugarlabs/www-sugarlabs) repository.
  * You can monitor [activities.sugarlabs.org](https://activities.sugarlabs.org/) for activities to download in Sugar.
  * You can choose to write your own [desktop activity][1] or write your own [web activity][5].

## <a name="DESIGN-TEAM"></a> Design
Design is also crucial to Sugar Labs - it is where new ideas and initiatives are formed into proper reports which can be worked on. You can either contribute a new design proposal or implement an existing one in the [Design Team User Experience Proposals wiki page](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Design_Team/Proposals).

## <a name="MARKETING-OUTREACH"></a> Marketing/Outreach
You can help to increase the number of Sugar Labs software users through - 
  * Write translations, see [Translation Team](https://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Translation_Team) and [translate.sugarlabs.org](https://translate.sugarlabs.org/), thereby enhancing the user experience of users from other countries speaking other languages.
  * Publish blogs and detail your experience using Sugar Labs software, hence introducing more people to use Sugar Labs software.
  * Design and execute lesson plans to introduce more children and youths to Sugar Labs, either in schools, outside school or in an informal setting.

* [Hang out on the irc](irc://irc.freenode.net#sugar). Please stay for a
little while, as people will come and go at different times of the day.
* [Send an email on the mailing list][3]

Some of our developers have elected to be put on the list of mentors.
You can find the list [here][4].
