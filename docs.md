Contributing images
-------------------

* Make them 600px width, or less.

* You may need to highlight parts of the image.  Use color yellow (rgb
  255, 255, 0) at 30% opacity, in a layer with Multiply mode, over the
  screenshot layer.

* Code screenshots: use gedit and default GNOME theme to make them.
