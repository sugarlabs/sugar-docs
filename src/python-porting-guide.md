# Python 3 Porting Guide

Guide to porting Sugar Activities to Python 3.

## Required Skills

* application development in Python,
* Sugar activity development,
* knowledge of differences between Python 2 and Python 3.

## How to Port an Activity to Python 3:

* Quiesce the activity source by making sure the activity works properly before porting, closing any solved issues, merging any pull requests or branches and releasing the last Python 2 version; see the [activity maintainer checklist](contributing.md#checklist---maintainer).

* For activities known to work with Fedora 18, create a _fedora18_ branch and push; this branch will be for any future maintenance with Python 2,

* Use Sugar Toolkit for GTK 3 version 0.114 or later, built for Python 3, and test that `/usr/bin/python3` can import it, for example;
  ```python
  import sugar3
  ```

* If the activity uses `telepathy-python`, test and fix collaboration, then port to PyGObject binding `TelepathyGLib`, and test again, for example;
  ```python
  import telepathy
  ```
  should change to:
  ```python
  from gi.repository import TelepathyGLib
  ```
  Use constants from `TelepathyGLib`, and minimise changes, for example;
  ```python
  from telepathy.interfaces import CHANNEL
  ```
  should change to:
  ```python
  CHANNEL = TelepathyGLib.IFACE_CHANNEL
  ```
  Replace calls to `Channel` and `Connection` classes of
  `telepathy-python` with a dictonary of `dbus.Interface()`.  Look
  through the source code for constants used by `Channel` and `Connection`
  objects as keys.  Use these constants as keys to a dictonary of the
  `dbus.Interface()` objects.  For example;
  ```python
  Channel(self._connection.requested_bus_name, channel_path,
    ready_handler=self.__text_channel_ready_cb)
  ```
  should change to (ensure adding all key-interface pairs):
  ```python
  self.text_channel = {}
  self.text_proxy = dbus.Bus().get_object(
            self._connection.requested_bus_name, channel_path)
  self.text_channel[PROPERTIES_IFACE] = dbus.Interface(
            self.text_proxy, PROPERTIES_IFACE)
  ```
  Replace all bare references to `telepathy_text_chan` and
  `telepathy_tubes_chan`
  ```python
  self.telepathy_text_chan.AddMembers(
  ```
  should change to:
  ```python
  self.telepathy_text_chan[CHANNEL].AddMembers(
  ```
  Test and fix collaboration before proceeding further.

* Port from Python 2 to Python 3.
  Start your porting with [2to3](https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/2to3.html) tool,<br>
  In the terminal, type:
  ```shell
  2to3 -w -n *.py
  ```
* Change `exec` value in `activity.info` from `sugar-activity` to `sugar-activity3`
* Test the activity
* Check if the activity can be built,<br>
  In the terminal, type:
  ```shell
  python3 setup.py dist_xo
  ```

Follow the [Code Guidelines](https://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-docs/blob/master/src/contributing.md) during all porting.

Write any comments in the code, by adding **\# README:**, **\# TODO:** and **\# FIXME:** explaining what are the problems that you are having with that chunk of code. Put a link if it's necessary.

## Releasing Activities (for maintainers)

Once an activity is ported, a new release can be made. The major version
should be greater than the existing one.

Please follow
[this](contributing.md#checklist---maintainer)
guide for releasing a new version.

Avoid releasing Python 3 activities to https://activities.sugarlabs.org/ as these will not work on existing systems.
