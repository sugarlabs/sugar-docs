Setup a development environment
===============================

Sugar is made of several modules and it often depends on libraries which has not
yet been packaged in linux distributions. To make it easier for developers to
build from sources, we developed a set of scripts that automates builds and
other common development tasks.

First of all clone the sugar-build git repository

    git clone git://github.com/sugarlabs/sugar-build.git

Then enter the main directory and pull the source code.

<pre><code language='sh'>
cd sugar-build
./osbuild pull
</code></pre>

Enter the osbuild shell and start build.

<pre><code language='sh'>
./osbuild shell
build
</code></pre>

Finally run sugar.

<pre><code language='sh'>
run
</code></pre>

If anything goes wrong, you can check if there are known problems by looking
at the
[buildbot status](http://buildbot.sugarlabs.org/waterfall). If it's red
then something is wrong and hopefully developers will fix it soon. If it's
green then the issue is probably not yet known and you should report it.


Developing
----------

All the sources are inside the sugar-build directory. You can make
changes using any text editor. If sugar is already running stop it, then
restart it with

<pre><code language='sh'>
./osbuild run
</code></pre>

Once in a while you will want to update to the latest sources, issuing the
command

<pre><code language='sh'>
./osbuild pull
</code></pre>


Commands reference
------------------

You can run the commands as osbuild arguments

<pre><code language='sh'>
./osbuild build
./osbuild run
</code></pre>

Or inside a shell

<pre><code language='sh'>
./osbuild

[sugar-build $] build
[sugar-build $] run
</code></pre>

The following commands are available

#### pull

Pull the latest source code. All modules are pulled unless one is
specified.

#### build

Build the source code. All the modules are built unless one is
specified.

#### run

Run sugar.

#### check

Run tests for sugar-build and all the modules that provides them. It
should usually be run before submitting patches or pushing changes.

#### clean

Delete the build artifacts. If a module is specified only the source
directory of that module is cleaned.

#### shell

Open a shell inside the build environment.


Preferences reference
---------------------

You can set a few options by creating a sugar-build/prefs.json file. For
example

<pre><code language='json'>
{
    "output": "HDMI1",
    "resolution": "1024x768"
}
</code></pre>

The following preferences are available

#### github

You can specify a list of forks and repositories for which you have ssh access,
so that remotes will be setup automatically for those. For example

<pre><code language='json'>
{
    "github": {
        "forks": [
            "myname/sugar.git",
            "myname/sugar-docs.git",
        ],
        "ssh": [
            "sugarlabs/sugar.git",
            "sugarlabs/sugar-docs.git"
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>

When adding a new module to the lists, you need to delete its directory for
the remotes to be switched over.

#### resolution

This option is only valid when running from X Window. It specifies
the resolution of the window containing the sugar desktop in the
form \[width\]x\[height\]. Otherwise the whole screen is used.

#### output

This option is only valid when running from a text console. Sugar
does not work properly on multiple video outputs, so we need to
select one and turn off the others. By default we select the first
output listed by RandR. You can set this variable to override that
with any other of the connected outputs reported by the xrandr
command, for example VGA1 if you have an external monitor.

### use_broot

Set the option to false if you don't want to build and run in a chroot. If
you don't know what that means you'd better not use the option. This is
currently supported only on Fedora 19, on other distributions it's likely
to fail unless you manually install the required dependencies.

More configuration options
--------------------------

### Activities

When you first build the dev-environment, you will notice that there
are only a few activities installed by default. In Sugar, additional
activities are usually stored in <pre><code
language='sh'>~/Activities</code></pre>
However in the dev-environment, they are stored in <pre><code
language='sh'>sugar-build/activities</code></pre>

### dotsugar

By default, Sugar stores configuration files, logs, and the datastore
in <pre><code language='sh'>~/.sugar</code></pre>
In the dev-enviroment, these files are stored in <pre><code
language='sh'>sugar-build/home/dotsugar</code></pre>

### gconf

Sugar uses gconf for a number of different settings. In the dev-environment, these settings are found in <pre><code
language='sh'>sugar-build/home/default/config/gconf</code></pre>
