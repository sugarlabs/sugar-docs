What Can I Do Now?
==================

So, now that you've setup the development environment you will
probably want to do something. Well there are many things you can
do, but here are some we've put together:

* [Write a new sugar activity](activity.md.html)
* [**Have a look at the Top Ten Tickets This Week!**](https://github.com/ignaciouy/sugar-irc/wiki/Top-Ten-Tickets-This-Week)
* [Check out bugs and feature requests on the bug tracker](http://bugs.sugarlabs.org)
* And anything else!

I'm Stuck!
==========

Well, don't worry; there are real people here who will try to help you. Some
ways to get in touch with real people are:

* [Hang out on the irc](irc://irc.freenode.net#sugar). Please stay for a
little while, as people will come and go at different times of the day.
* [Send an email on the mailing list](http://lists.sugarlabs.org/listinfo/sugar-devel)

Some of our developers have elected to be put on the list of mentors. You can find
the list [here](http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Mentors).
